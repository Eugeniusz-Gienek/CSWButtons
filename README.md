CustomSmartWatch Buttons
The library for the diy smartwatch projects, which operates with their buttons.
Part of a project which I am working on - the diy smartwatch software, which I am creating for the LILYGOÂ® TTGO 1.54 Inch Wrist E-paper ESP32 DIY smartwatch with ePaper display.
I think it may be useful for someone else so I make this as a library with the ability to use more than just one button as it is in the case of the mentioned above smartwatch.

The SimpleTimer library is located in the examples folder - put it in the Arduino libraries folder.
