CustomSmartWatch Buttons
The library for the diy smartwatch projects, which operates with their buttons.
Part of a project which I am working on - the diy smartwatch software, which I am creating for the [LILYGOÂ® TTGO 1.54 Inch Wrist E-paper ESP32 DIY smartwatch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003095240476.html) with ePaper display.
I think it may be useful for someone else so I make this as a library with the ability to use more than just one button as it is in the case of the mentioned above smartwatch.

The [SimpleTimer library](https://github.com/jfturcot/SimpleTimer) is located for convenience in the examples folder - put it in the Arduino libraries folder.
